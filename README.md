# MineSweeper
My attempt at recreating minesweeper in swift.
## FAQ
### Why did you make this?
I needed to make a game for my APCSA last marking period benchmark assessment and I decided minesweeper would be fun to make.
### How long did this take to make?
Around 5-6 hours of code.
### Did you make the sprites/graphics?
NONE OF THE SPRITES OR GRAPHICS ARE MINE. Most of them are from the game itself via google images.
### What are the controls?
Controls should be displayed when you click the 'help' button.
### How do I run this?
1. Download XCode onto your computer. 
2. Hit the little play button that at the moment of writing this can be found in the top left. 
3. You're set!
- *You can also connect your phone to your computer and select it from the dropdown menu next to the play menu to download this to your phone.*
### How do I set up a custom game?
Click the 'options' button and then 'custom game' and you should be able to configure it from there.
